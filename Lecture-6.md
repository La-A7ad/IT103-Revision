### Introduction to Wireless Communications

**Q1: What makes wireless communication different from wired communication?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Wireless communication does not use wires, offering more freedom but also more troubles such as time-varying random behavior (fading), signal power decay, object obstruction, moving objects, multiple paths, and unwanted interferences. Both share common problems like receiver noise and finite bandwidth causing inter-symbol interference (ISI), but wireless communication requires different link layer operation methods and multiple access techniques.
