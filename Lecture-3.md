### Classic Algorithm Example: Search

**Q10: Describe the difference between sequential search and binary search.**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Sequential Search: Checks each element one by one until the target is found.
- Binary Search: Divides the search interval in half repeatedly, utilizing the sorted order of the list.
</details>

**Q11: How does the order of data affect the efficiency of search algorithms?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
If the data is sorted, algorithms like binary search can be used to significantly reduce the number of comparisons needed compared to a sequential search.

### Algorithms and Programming

**Q12: What is the purpose of programming languages in relation to algorithms?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Programming languages provide a level of abstraction that is more understandable to humans than binary machine language, allowing for the implementation of algorithms.
</details>

**Q13: What are assembly languages and how do they relate to machine language?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Assembly languages, introduced in the early 1950s, provide abbreviations for machine language instructions, making it easier for humans to write low-level code.
</details>

**Q14: What are high-level languages and when were they introduced?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
High-level languages, introduced in the late 1950s, provide more "programmer-friendly" ways for humans to write computer code, such as C++, FORTRAN, LISP, JAVA, VB, C#.
</details>

### Program Translation

**Q15: What is the role of program translation in computing?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Program translation converts assembly or high-level languages into binary machine language, translating source code into object code (machine code).
</details>

**Q16: What are the two methods of program translation?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
1. Interpretation
2. Compilation
</details>

**Q17: What are the characteristics of interpretation?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Reads and translates statements one at a time.
- Doesn't optimize across an entire program.
- No file of object code.
- Error checking only happens at runtime.
- Slower runtime but no compile time.
</details>

**Q18: What are the characteristics of compilation?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Reads and translates the entire program.
- Can optimize and store result as an executable file.
- Compile-time error checking.
- Faster runtime but requires compile time.
</details>

### Concepts

**Q19: What is compile-time (noun)?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The process of compiling a program from an assembly or high-level language into binary machine language and storing it on the computerâ€™s hard disk.
</details>

**Q20: What is compile time (adj noun)?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The amount of time it takes a compiler to translate (or "compile") a program.
</details>

**Q21: What is run-time (noun)?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The process of executing a compiled stored program.
</details>

**Q22: What is run time (adj noun)?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The amount of time it takes a program to run.
</details>

**Q23: Where can errors be found in the programming process?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Errors can be found at compile-time and runtime.
</details>

**Q24: When is error checking done during the programming process?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Error checking is done at compile-time.
</details>
