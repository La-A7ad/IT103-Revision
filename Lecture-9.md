<summary>Answer</summary>
Paravirtualization runs a guest OS on a type 1 hypervisor without hardware support by modifying the OS to replace kernel instructions with hypercalls, which are function calls to the hypervisor.
</details>

---

### Memory Virtualization

**Q18: How does memory virtualization work in a virtualized environment?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The hypervisor allocates memory to each VM. The guest OS is unaware it only has a portion of actual RAM. The hypervisor maintains a shadow page table to manage memory allocation and reflects changes made by the guest OS.
</details>

**Q19: What is the role of the shadow page table in memory virtualization?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The shadow page table mirrors the page table maintained by the guest OS. Whenever the guest OS wants to change its page table, it triggers a trap to the hypervisor, which updates both the shadow page table and the guest OS's page table.
</details>
