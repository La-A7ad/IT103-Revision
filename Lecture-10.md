### Lecture 10 - Network Security Introduction

**Q1: What is the definition of security in a system, application, or protocol?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Security of a system, application, or protocol is always relative to a set of desired properties and an adversary with specific capabilities. For example, standard file access permissions in Linux and Windows are not effective against an adversary who can boot from a CD.
</details>

**Q2: What are the three primary security goals?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The three primary security goals are Integrity, Confidentiality, and Availability.
</details>

**Q3: What is confidentiality in the context of network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Confidentiality is the avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of information. It involves protecting data, providing access for those allowed to see it while disallowing others from learning anything about its content.
</details>

**Q4: What is encryption and its purpose in confidentiality?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Encryption is the transformation of information using a secret called an encryption key, so that the transformed information can only be read using another secret called the decryption key.
</details>

**Q5: What is access control in network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Access control refers to the rules and policies that limit access to confidential information to those people and/or systems with a “need to know,” determined by identity or role.
</details>

**Q6: What are the three common methods of authentication?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The three common methods of authentication are: something the person has (e.g., smart card), something the person knows (e.g., password), and something the person is (e.g., fingerprint).
</details>

**Q7: What is the role of authorization in confidentiality?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Authorization determines if a person or system is allowed access to resources based on an access control policy, preventing attackers from gaining unauthorized access.
</details>

**Q8: What is the importance of physical security in network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Physical security establishes physical barriers to limit access to protected resources, including locks, windowless rooms, sound-dampening materials, and Faraday cages.
</details>

**Q9: Define integrity in the context of network security.**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Integrity is the property that information has not been altered in an unauthorized way.
</details>

**Q10: What are some tools used to ensure data integrity?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Tools for ensuring data integrity include backups, checksums, and data correcting codes.
</details>

**Q11: What is availability in network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Availability is the property that information is accessible and modifiable in a timely fashion by those authorized to do so.
</details>

**Q12: What are some tools used to ensure availability?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Tools for ensuring availability include physical protections and computational redundancies.
</details>

**Q13: What does AAA stand for in network security concepts?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
AAA stands for Authenticity, Anonymity, and Assurance.
</details>

**Q14: What is assurance in the context of network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Assurance refers to how trust is provided and managed in computer systems, depending on policies, permissions, and protections.
</details>

**Q15: What is authenticity and its primary tool?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Authenticity is the ability to determine that statements, policies, and permissions issued by persons or systems are genuine. The primary tool for authenticity is digital signatures.
</details>

**Q16: What is anonymity in network security, and what are some tools to achieve it?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Anonymity is the property that certain records or transactions are not attributable to any individual. Tools to achieve anonymity include aggregation, mixing, proxies, and pseudonyms.
</details>

**Q17: Define eavesdropping in the context of network threats and attacks.**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Eavesdropping is the interception of information intended for someone else during its transmission over a communication channel.
</details>

**Q18: What is alteration as a network threat?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Alteration is the unauthorized modification of information, exemplified by a man-in-the-middle attack.
</details>

**Q19: What is a denial-of-service attack?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Denial-of-service (DoS) is the interruption or degradation of a data service or information access, such as email spam filling up a mail queue.
</details>

**Q20: What does masquerading mean in network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Masquerading is the fabrication of information that is purported to be from someone who is not the actual author.
</details>

**Q21: What is repudiation in the context of network threats?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Repudiation is the denial of a commitment or data receipt, involving an attempt to back out of a contract or protocol.
</details>

**Q22: What is correlation and traceback in network security?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Correlation and traceback involve integrating multiple data sources to determine the source of a particular data stream or piece of information.
</details>
